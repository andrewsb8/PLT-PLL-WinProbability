This was a project in 2019 to brush up my python ML skills and apply it to bracket
prediction for the Premier Lacrosse League 2019 playoffs and consolation brackets.

This project was a partial influence to continue and make the win probability
code which was a much more involved project and used by ProLacrosseTalk for multiple
seasons.
