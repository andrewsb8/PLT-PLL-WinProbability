# ProLacrosseTalk Win Probability and Predictions for the Premier Lacrosse League

This repository contains scripts for Bracket Prediction, which utilized a binary tree classifier to select winners of Premier Lacrosse League playoff and consolation games in 2019 based on regular season performance, and a Win Probability Model used to calculate the in-game win probabilities for each team in a PLL game over the course of the game.

The Win Probability Model was utilized on the ProLacrosseTalk website for two seasons before I discontinued using the model. See Win-Probability-Model for more information.
