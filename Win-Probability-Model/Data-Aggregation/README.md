The script aggregate_data_creation.py takes raw data from sheet Weekly_Results in PLL_Data.xlsx and creates the sheet Weekly_Aggregates (which contain teams' weekly averages and aggregate stats leading up to that week). The model to predict the winner of each game each week
was to explicitly compare team's aggregate and averaged stats leading up to the current
matchup.
