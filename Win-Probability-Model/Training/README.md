This python script takes the results of aggregate_data_creation.py in Data-Aggregation,
which is the Weekly_Aggregates sheet of PLL_Data.xlsx, and trains a supervised
logistic regression model on that information. The outputs are pickle objects of the
model and they are in the Prediction folder with the prediction scripts and outputs.
